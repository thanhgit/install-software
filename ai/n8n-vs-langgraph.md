- #### Think in layers: business automation AND sophisticated reasoning

### People who: 
- #### 👉 Understand AI capabilities and data limitations
- #### 👉 Translate messy business needs into structured, reusable data
- #### 👉 Define Data Products with AI-readiness in mind
- #### 👉 Treat prompts and metadata as part of the same design

### Here’s what companies should do now:
- #### ✅ Create cross-functional `"AI+Data Pods"`
- #### ✅ Incentivize shared outcomes (not siloed wins)
- #### ✅ Invest in data product managers with ML context
- #### ✅ Stop thinking of data as ‘infrastructure’, and start treating it like code for intelligence
