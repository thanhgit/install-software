# Operating principles of Enterprise AI:
![](./media/ai-transformation-journey.png)

- #### 1. Enterprise AI won’t be centralized => `it’ll be a choreography of agents across your stack`
- #### 2. AI adoption won’t fail because of models => `It’ll fail because of interoperability`
- #### 3. MCPs and Agent-to-Agent standards will become the TCP/IP of enterprise AI
- #### 4. Agent-to-agent coordination is the enterprise glue of the AI era
- #### 5. `Orchestration will shift from rule-based to context-based`: dynamic, adaptive, truly intelligent
- #### 6. Agent networks will decide who leads based on intent, not hierarchy
- #### 7. Salesforce, Workday, Box... each will own its workflow, but not the full customer journey
- #### 8. The monolith is dead => `Long live the mesh of intelligent agents`
- #### 9. Agents are not products. They’re participants in workflows.
- #### 10. `Composable AI is like Lego for workflows`. You bring your blocks. The system will build itself.
- #### 11. AI is no longer a layer; it’s the fabric stitching the enterprise together
- #### 12. `AgentOps will become the new DevOps`
- #### 13. You won’t debug code, you’ll debug conversations between agents
- #### 14. Legacy IT is already struggling => `Agent-based architectures will widen the gap`
- #### 15. Building an agent is easy => `Getting 50 to work together is not`
- #### 16. Enterprise IT isn’t ready. Most data isn’t even accessible, let alone AI-ready.
- #### 17. Agent networks will force a reckoning with your data infrastructure
- #### 18. Horizontal agent orchestration will emerge when no clear system owns the workflow
- #### 19. Agent interactions will need the same auditability and traceability as financial systems.
- #### 20. You’ll need `governance not just over data, but over agent behavior`
- #### 21. How your agents reason will be subject to compliance
- #### 22. An agent is only as trustworthy as the data it’s trained on.
- #### 23. The battle for AI supremacy `will be won in orchestration, not inference`
- #### 24. `Vertical agents will dominate first` - `Horizontal orchestration will follow`
- #### 25. The true value of Enterprise AI lies in seamless agent collaboration, adapting in real-time across systems 
- #### 26. `Trust in emergent behavior`. What happens when agents "coordinate" in ways we didn’t design for - but are still technically compliant?
